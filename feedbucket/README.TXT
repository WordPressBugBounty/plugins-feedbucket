Enable your clients and team members to submit feedback using screenshot and recordings on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

[Feedbucket](https://feedbucket.app?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplace) is a visual website feedback tool designed for web agencies. It allows your clients and team members to submit feedback without leaving the website.

Clients can provide feedback using annotated screenshots or recordings. Feedbucket automatically captures essential details like the page URL, browser type, and operating system.

Your team manages all feedback in the project management tools they already use and know. No need to switch between different apps or learn new systems - everything stays in your familiar workflow.

Stop using a million back-and-forth emails with clients during website reviews. 

Simplify your website review process with Feedbucket - the tool that brings structure to client website feedback.
